# Relayer server

Relayer is used to received signed transactions from users and broadcast to the network by paying fees. This will allow users execute gasless transactions. 

We plan to follow https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/sending-gasless-transactions guide to enable this.

Currently, the endpoint is available, but the service is not finished yet.
